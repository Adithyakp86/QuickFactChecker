## 🚀 Live Demo
**Try it now:** [https://quickfactchecker.onrender.com/](https://quickfactchecker.onrender.com/)

## 📌 Project Overview
QuickFactChecker is a **machine learning–based web app** that helps detect whether a news article is **real** or **fake**.
It uses different models (e.g., Naive Bayes, LSTM) trained on the **LIAR dataset** to evaluate credibility and assist users in identifying potentially misleading information.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepika14145/QuickFactChecker.git
   cd QuickFactChecker
   ```
2. Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
      python -m venv venv
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate   # for Linux/Mac
      venv\Scripts\activate      # for Windows
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Download NLTK Corpora:
```bash
python scripts/setup_nltk.py
```

## 📊 Baseline Model Comparison

We evaluated three models on the LIAR dataset using TF-IDF features. Example results (accuracy & precision):
example:
| Model               | Accuracy | Precision |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|
| Naive Bayes         | 0.XXXX   | 0.XXXX    |
| Logistic Regression | 0.XXXX   | 0.XXXX    |
| Random Forest       | 0.XXXX   | 0.XXXX    |

Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy among the tested baselines.
### 🔧 Run the comparison script
To reproduce these results, run:
```bash
scripts/fake_news_logreg_rf.py
```

## ▶️ Usage

1. Run the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. The app will provide predictions on whether a news article is real or fake based on the input.
   
## 🛠️ Model Training
To retrain or experiment with the models, run the provided Jupyter notebooks. Ensure your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed.
### Naive Bayes
Run the notebook:
 ```bash
jupyter notebook fake-news-detection-using-nb.ipynb
 ```

### LSTM
Run the notebook:
 ```bash
jupyter notebook fake-news-detection-using-lstm.ipynb
 ```

### Dataset Analysis
```bash
jupyter notebook liar-data-analysis.ipynb
 ```
